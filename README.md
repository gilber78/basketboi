## Setup
### API credentials
To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile settings and select 'Generate New Token'. Copy the generated token, paste and save it to a file named /app/data/access_token. This will allow you to connect to Kaggle and download the database when the program is run.
